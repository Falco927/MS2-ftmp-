     For the first time users goal it will be to maximize the number of users by offering the best
     experience to the target audience and engagement-ability of the memory game in a way
     users will continue to play and maintain interest and motivation to get to the next-level of
     the game and make them want to come and play again.
     The Memory-game might keep users maintain goal oriented behaviors, emotional
     attachment to the game and make them achieve the desired goal which is to score more
     points and win the game.

     It is very clear the usability of the game is very important goal and one of the most important
     goals to be achieved, we want users to consistently use the memory game during their
     travel, disoccupied time or even spare time but at same time to stimulate the use of the brain
     and to keep them entertained while having fun.

     For our frequent user goals is to make them feel the first time experience once more even
     after users have been playing for some considerable time they will always come back and
     discover new ways of having fun like their first time but also refer to the fruit land memory
     game to other new users and keep the memory game cycle.
