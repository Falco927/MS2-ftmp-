# MEMORY GAME 

This Memory game was created for Milestone 2 Interactive Frontend Development, with
aim of offering a fun-filled and worthwhile activity for both children and adults.
The main reason I developed this idea it was to allow users to socialize and having fun
while developing important cognitive skills. 
A Very simple game to play with 12 cards in which the users have to turn over a pair
of matching cards. If a player suceeds in matching a pair, they have another turn and
continue until they fail to match two cards , basically the objetive of the game is to find the most matches.  
This is not a new concept but it helped me to understand how to create something interesting and funny for any age and apply some of the learned technologies.   
In this Project, I tried to implement most of the learned concepts and I used them to 
develop this game concept.

 ##  User stories 

__Project Goals__ 

The Main Purpose of this Project was to create a memory game with cards by using some of the learned technologies such HTML,CSS and Javascript. This macthing game is mostly for families with adults and children interested in develop and improve cognitive skills,focus,enhance brain functions,train for visual memory and have fun while enjoy the game together.    

     
__First time users__ 
      
For the first time users goal, it will be to maximize the number of users by offering the best experience to the target audience and engagement-ability of the memory game in a way users will continue to play and maintain interest and motivation to get to the next level of the game and make them want to come and play again.
The Memory-game might keep users maintain goal-oriented behaviors, emotional
attachment to the game and make them achieve the desired goal which is to score more
points and win the game.

__Returning users__ 

It is very clear the usability of the game is a very important goal and one of the most important goals to be achieved, we want users to consistently use the memory game during their travel,  or even spare time but at the same time to stimulate the use of the brain and to keep them entertained while having fun.

__Frequent users__ 
     
For our frequent user goals is to make them feel the first time experience once more even after users have been playing for some considerable time they will always come back and discover new ways of having fun like their first time but also refer to the  memory game to other new users and keep the memory game cycle.

 ## Media 
 Most of the animation images used in this project were based on Memory game : [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sId4aKhogac&list=PLLX1I3KXZ-YH-woTgiCfONMya39-Ty8qw&index=4) 

 ## Self-Evaluation 
 I enjoyed the process of "building" the project but in some areas, it was hard for me  to tackle some challenges due to the lack of knowledge, especially Javascript, which I tried to implement some code and in end I found myself overcomplicating and creating unecessary issues. 

 When I started this project all the cards were organized and aligned but as I was moving forward I tried to implement the horizontal flip and instead of finishing with desired  design and style I was unable to get back the initial design, but with all the challenges 
 I believe I have learned a lot and had the chance to practice for future projects.
