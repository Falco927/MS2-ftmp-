# MEMORY GAME 

This Memory game was created for Milestone 2 Interactive Frontend Development, with 
aim of offering a fun-filled and worthwhile activity for both children and adults.
The main reason I developed this idea it was to allow users to socialize and having fun 
while developing important cognitive skills.  
A Very simple game to play with 12 cards in which the users have to turn over a pair 
of matching cards. If a player suceeds in matching a pair, they have another turn and
continue until they fail to match two cards , basically the objetive of the game is to find the most matches.  
  
For my main Project goal/ User goal...   

This is not a new concept but it helped me to understand how to create something 
interesting and funny for any ages and apply some of the learned.    
In this Project I tried to implement some of the learned technologies  and I used to  
develop this game concept.
