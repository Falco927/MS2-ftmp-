# MEMORY GAME 

This Memory game was created for Milestone 2 Interactive Frontend Development, with 
aim of offering a fun-filled and worthwhile activity for both children and adults.
The main reason I developed this idea it was to allow users to socialize and having fun 
while developing important cognitive skills.  
A Very simple game to play with 12 cards in which the users have to turn over a pair 
of matching cards. If a player suceeds in matching a pair, they have another turn and
continue until they fail to match two cards , basically the objetive of the game is to find the most matches.  
  
For my main Project goal/ User goal...   

This is not a new concept but it helped me to understand how to create something 
interesting and funny for any ages and apply some of the learned techonologies.    
In this Project I tried to implement most of the learned concepts and I used to  
develop this game concept.

It is very clear the usability of the game is a very important goal and one of the most important goals to be achieved, we want users to consistently use the memory game during their travel,  or even spare time but at the same time to stimulate the use of the brain and to keep them entertained while having fun.

For our frequent user goals is to make them feel the first time experience once more even after users have been playing for some considerable time they will always come back and discover new ways of having fun like their first time but also refer to the  memory game to other new users and keep the memory game cycle.
